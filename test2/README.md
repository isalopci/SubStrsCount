Repeated Substrings

Author: Isabella Lopez Cifuentes

Description: 

This script has a class repeatedSubstrings with two methods:

generateSubStrs() is used to generate a list of substrings of a given string.

countSubStrs() is used to identify how many substrings of 4 characters appear more than once along a given string. The methodsâ€™s only argument is a string and it returns a dictionary with the substrings and the number of instances of that substring in the main string. 

Usage:

This script was coded using Python 3.9.2, therefore in order to run this code, it is necessary to have at least this version of python. 

Open your terminal, cd into the directory test2. Once there, you can run the drivers code test by running in the terminal:

python repeatedSubstrings.py 

or you can use the script class and methods as you wish by importing repeatedSubstrings.py file in your python script. For example: 

from repeatedSubstrings import repeatedSubstrings

for this, you have to copy repeaytedSubstrings.py file in the same path where you run your own python script.
After importing repeatedSubstrings, you can make use of the class and its methods.
